Run started at 17:29 on 20/03/14
Reason for running iteration: Well the first quick one didn't really do anything with so few walkers and steps, so here's one with a big number of both to see what happens for all these intermediate S0 galaxies with pd and ps < 0.8.

Run started at 18:01 on 23/03/14
Reason for running iteration: Starting in the central location of the parameter space rather than in the bottom right corner like the last run of S0s (pd ~ ps < 0.8). More walkers than last time too. 
Number of walkers : 150
Number of steps :400

Number of steps :75
